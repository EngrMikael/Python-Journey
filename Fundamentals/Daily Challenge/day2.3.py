Level 3: “Simple Login System” (if + dict)
Problem:

You have a dictionary of usernames and passwords:

accounts = {"michael": "pass123", "john": "hello", "admin": "root"}


Ask the user to input a username and password.
Then:

If username exists and password matches → print "Access Granted "

If username exists but password is wrong → print "Wrong password "

If username doesn’t exist → print "User not found "

Goal: Combine conditionals with dictionary lookups.
