# LEVEL 2 ‚Äî Deep Dive
# üß© Exercise 4: Class vs Instance Shadowing

# Add this to your Car test:

# car1.wheels = 8

# Then print:

# print(car1.wheels)
# print(car2.wheels)
# print(Car.wheels)


# Question: Why is car1‚Äôs value 
# different from the rest?

# (Hint: You ‚Äúshadowed‚Äù the class property 
# by creating a new instance property.)
