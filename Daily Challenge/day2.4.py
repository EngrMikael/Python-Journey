'''
Level 4: “Student Grader” (loop + if + efficiency)
Problem:

Given a dictionary of student scores:

grades = {"Anna": 87, "Ben": 92, "Chris": 74, "Diana": 59}


You must print:

"Anna: A" if score ≥ 90

"Ben: B" if 80–89

"Chris: C" if 70–79

"Diana: F" if below 70

Hint:

Use a loop through the dictionary and nested if statements.

Goal: Practice looping through dictionaries and applying multi-branch logic.
