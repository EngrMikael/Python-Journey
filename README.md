# 🐍 My Python Journey

Welcome to my **Python learning journey** — a personal space where I explore programming concepts, write code, and build understanding one step at a time.

## 🚀 About

This repository documents my growth as I learn **Python** with guidance from two mentors:
- **ChatGPT (GPT-5)** – for personalized lessons, practice exercises, and in-depth concept exploration  
- **Data with Baraa** – through his *Data with Baraa* tutorials on YouTube, focusing on data handling, analysis, and clean coding practices  

Together, these two paths — interactive guidance and structured learning — shape how I study and apply Python in real-world scenarios.

- Writing clean and efficient code  
- Data handling and analysis with `pandas` and `numpy`  
- Introduction to backend and API development (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL)  
- Building small projects to apply what I learn
